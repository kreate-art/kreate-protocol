# :warning: [WIP] Teiki Protocol :construction:

![Teiki protocol identity dependencies](docs/dependencies.png)

We currently maintain the [Teiki protocol specifications on Notion](https://shinka-network.notion.site/Teiki-Protocol-ae97c4c66db447278ea8da9cd7b860a2).

This repository contains the implementation in Generation I. The code is a **work in progress** and is **not production ready**. We plan to launch a public testnet in January and a mainnet beta in February 2023.
